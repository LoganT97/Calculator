# Calculator

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript calculator that allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations. The calculator supports two numbers and one operator at a time, and it returns an error if more than two numbers or multiple operators are entered. Additionally, there is a limit of 10 integers for the output.

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply visit the live demo and follow these steps:

1. Click on the number buttons to input your desired numbers. The numbers will be displayed in the input field at the top of the calculator.

2. Click on the operator button (+, -, *, or /) to select the arithmetic operation you want to perform.

3. After selecting the operator, input the second number using the number buttons.

4. Once both numbers are entered, click on the equal button (=) to perform the calculation.

5. The result will be displayed in the input field. If the result exceeds 10 integers, it will be truncated to fit the limit.

6. To clear the input and start a new calculation, click on the clear button (C).

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the calculator:

1. Input the first number: 4.
2. Select the operator: +.
3. Input the second number: 5.
4. Click the equal button (=).
5. The result 9 will be displayed in the input field.

## Limitations

-  The calculator only supports two numbers and one operator at a time. Entering more than two numbers or multiple operators will result in an error.

- The output is limited to a maximum of 10 integers. If the result exceeds this limit, it will return an error.
